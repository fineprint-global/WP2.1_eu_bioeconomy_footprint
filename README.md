# EU Bioeconomy Footprint 

### Calculations
To calculate the cropland footprint of the EU non-food bioeconomy, run the script [footprints.R](./footprints.R). The required input data consist of the EXIOBASE MRIO database, which has to be downloaded from www.exiobase.eu in order to run the script, and output files generated with IIASA's LANDFLOW model, which are located in the folder [input](./input).



### Maps and figures
To produce the maps, run the script [maps.R](./maps.R). The mosaic chart is generated running the script [mosaic.R](./mosaic.R). All required input data are either located in the folder [input](./input), or are downloaded automatically from [http://spam05.harvestchoice.org/v3r2/tiff/](http://spam05.harvestchoice.org/v3r2/tiff/) when running the code.
